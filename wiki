## Song List App
This is a basic console application that will emulate the main features of a music streaming service such as Spotify or Apple Music. The basic application is able to store a list of song objects. Each song object can store the artistâ€™s name, the song title and the current number of times the song has been played.  
  
## Main Features
The application has the following features:
1. Add a new song to the list of songs
2. Remove a new song from the list of songs
3. Print a list of all the songs stored
4. Print a list of songs over a given number of plays

## Testing
Insert sufficient screen shots to illustrate that all the features work.
